<!-- 
In this lecture I learn about attributes in HTML.
Attributes are additional settings that we can use to customize an element.

<!-- 
Youâ€™ve been asked to write a Wikipedia article about one of your heroes (dead or alive).

Create a wiki_article.html file that mimics their wiki profile.

Make sure to include the following:

One heading that says "Biography".
An image of that person that includes alternative text.
One paragraph with at least 2 sentences.
One link in the text (opens on a new tab).
Bonus: How can we adjust the size of the image using attributes? How can we make the image a hyperlink?
