<!-- 
In this lecture I learn about the HTML structure and how to create a basic HTML document.

The <!DOCTYPE html> is the document type declaration that appears at the top of a .html file 
and tells the browser that our file is written in HTML5. This is used with a <html> element 
containing all the code processed on the page.
 --> 

<!-- 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  Code goes here
</html> 

Notice how the <!DOCTYPE html> doesnâ€™t have a closing tag, while <html> does.

Inside <html>, there should be two elements:

<head> contains all the info for your browser that's not visible on the page.
<body> contains all of the content that you will end up seeing on the page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    Some code goes here
  </head>
  <body>
    A lot more goes here
  </body>
</html>

The <title> element goes in the <head> and assigns text to the browser tab.
And all the "main" code goes in the <body> element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Place your page title here.</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Place your paragraph text here.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
