<!-- 
 In this lecture I learn about links and images in HTML.

 We can use the <a> anchor element! This link tag allows us to add a hyperlink to a piece of text.
 -->

<!--    
Let's see how we can do this:

<a href="https://archive.org/web">Internet Archive</a>

Here, the <a> anchor element is similar to other tags, where the text inside is what is displayed. 
But what about the href inside the opening tag?

An href, or hyperlink reference, is a reference or pointer to another website that is linked in our HTML. 
When the text “Internet Archive” is clicked, the HTML will redirect to that site, which in our case, 
is https://archive.org/web.

Note: This can also be used to point to an email or phone number using a mailto:, tel:, or sms: parameter:

<a href="mailto:frankie@gmail.com">📧</a>
<a href="tel:212-555-2368">🤙</a>
<a href="sms:320-250-HTML">💬</a>
-->

<p>Here's a cute pic:</p>
<img src="https://i.redd.it/5unn16axx1v81.jpg">

The <img> image element is another self-closing tag, so it doesn't have a closing tag.

src attribute, which stands for “source”, specifies the file path of the image.
"https://i.redd.it/5unn16axx1v81.jpg" is the image path.

Can you create a web page with pet.html to help your friend find their critter?

It should include the following:

The pet name.
A pet pic with the <img> image element.
A short description.
Contact info with the <a> anchor element.
