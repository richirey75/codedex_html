  <h1>Text Formatting in HTML</h1>
  
  <p>This is an example of <b>bold text</b>, <i>italicized text</i>, 
  <u>underlined text</u>, and <s>strikethrough text</s>.</p>
  
  <p>HTML allows you to format text to emphasize certain parts of your content.</p>
  
  <p>For example, you can use the <b>bold</b> tag to make important words stand out, 
  or the <i>italic</i> tag for emphasis.</p>
  
  <p>Remember to use these formatting elements judiciously to enhance readability!</p>

The tags above are good for learning how to style text with basic HTML, but are no 
longer best practice. Other ways to style text will be covered in the CSS course.
