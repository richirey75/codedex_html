<!-- 
This is the end of chapter 1, here is a refresher of what I learned:

HTML elements, tags, and indentation.
Heading tags: <h1> - <h6>.
Paragraph and line breaks: <p>, <br>.
Text formatting: <b>, <i>, <u>, <s>.
Unordered and ordered lists: <ul>, <ol>.
Links and images: <a>, <img>.
-->

<!-- 
Create a band.html page for your favorite artist using all the elements we learned and at least two types of text formatting.
It should include the following:

The name of the artist.
A picture of the artist or album cover.
A short blurb about the artist.
A link to the artist's website.
The members in an unordered list.
Top 5 favorite songs in an ordered list.
When it's done, take a screenshot and click the Twitter icon to post your band page! ðŸŽ¸
