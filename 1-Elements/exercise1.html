In this lecture I learn about the history of HTML
and we wrote our first tho lines of HTML code.
-->
<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a basic HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html> -->
